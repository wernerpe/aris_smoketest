# Decisions — the numbers, and where each one is anchored

## FINAL RIG values (2026-08-21) — the drawing decides

The user's final-rig files (`raw_slack_file_dump/`: the "3 arms, 1 up, 1 side,
1 down" PDF+DXF and the pen-holder CAD) replace every placeholder below.
Extraction, cross-checks and the independent verification live in
`docs/FINAL_RIG.md`; the machine-readable geometry is `aris_sixarm/rig_final.py`
and the registry is `fleet.FLEET` (= `FLEET_FINAL`).  The legacy table at the
bottom of this file remains the record of the six-arm era, and
`fleet.FLEET_SIXARM` keeps that layout runnable bit for bit.

| Quantity | FINAL value | Source / provenance |
|---|---|---|
| Arm count & mounts | **3 arms: 13 upright (tabletop), 31 inverted (under central beam), 2 side (vertical plate, J1 horizontal)** | drawing MTEXT names the arms; plate solids + dims 45,7 / 55,8 / 34,9 / 91,6 |
| Arm base poses | 13: (0.88043, −0.12680, 0.01070) rotz(π/2) · 31: (0.24491, 1.25678, 0.92200) rotx(π) · 2: (1.60984, 1.25723, 0.77600) roty(−π/2)rotz(π), canvas m | DXF solids, verified independently to ≤0.011 cm (`FINAL_RIG.md` table) |
| Inverted base → paper | **0.92200 m** (was the H_INV debate: 0.92/0.924/0.97/1.00) | plate bottom 155.868 − paper 63.668 cm; within 2 mm of the 2026-07-07 rig survey (0.924). `H_INV_DEFAULT` stays a LEGACY knob; final poses ignore it |
| Sheet | **1.8034 × 1.700 m**, a paper web with roll/winder transport | paper solid 40; roll & rods are collision boxes |
| Pen tip offset | **`PEN_EXT` = 0.110 below hand TCP, unchanged** — the CAD does NOT confirm it (10° build: tip (−8, 0, +45.3) mm from TCP, axis tilted 10°; 23° clutch build: protrusion adjustable). The real-touchdown measurement outranks a CAD whose deployed configuration is unconfirmed; ASK the user which build + protrusion ships | pen-holder CAD extraction (`FINAL_RIG.md` Pen holder); gate-B touchdown 2026-07-12 |
| Pen collision capsule | **r = 0.05 m** (`rig_final.PEN_R_FINAL`), the union envelope of both holder builds incl. the clutch at 0.209 m flange→tip | CAD envelope; legacy rig keeps r = 0.03 |
| Frame obstacle | **35 conservative boxes** active in lattice, validator, atlas, and scene_check (its own derivation) | `rig_final.FRAME_BOXES_W_CM`, independently verified containment |
| Static clearance margin | **Z_STATIC 0.02 + CALIB_STATIC 0.03** vs structure; inter-arm stays SAFETY 0.05 + CALIB 0.03 | Z_PAPER convention for static surfaces; calib documented below |
| Calibration margin (0.03 m) | **KEPT for the final rig** — the drawing is a plan, not an as-built survey, no base has been surveyed at this geometry, and the drawing itself warns arm 2's plate-to-boom joint is "not stiff and stable". Drop it (per arm) the day a survey lands; arm 2 last | drawing MTEXT warning; `rig_final.CALIB_STATIC`, `coordination.CALIB_M` |
| Ready poses | 13: legacy `Q_READY_FLOOR` (checked clean) · 31: **`Q_READY_INV_FINAL`** (the legacy pose dips the pen 6.6 mm below the paper at h=0.922 and grazes the boom — refused by the gate, pinned in tests) · 2: **`Q_READY_WALL`** (derived; no wall arm ever existed) | `frames.py` provenance comments; `tests/test_final_rig.py` |
| Sequencer/conductor fixtures | draw 0.12 m/s, transit 0.80 m/s, qd-frac 0.6, freeze-in-place idle — carried over unchanged | no new evidence against them; re-examined per drawing by `select_profile` |
| Bench corpus | generators re-anchored to the ACTIVE rig (hatch on arm 31's patch clamped to the sheet; ray/spiral radii scale to min(sheet)/2) | `aris_sixarm/bench/__init__.py` |

## Legacy — numbers the upstream repos disagree on (six-arm era)

The `Aris_Kindt` branches carry conflicting values. Every pick below was made
for the SIX-ARM layout (`fleet.FLEET_SIXARM`), which regression tests keep
runnable; the final rig above supersedes it as the active registry.

| Quantity | Values in the wild | We use | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inverted base → paper | 0.92 (verbal) · 0.924 (cm sheet, "authoritative") · 0.97 (GUI SCENE_ARGS) · 1.8542 world (booth URDF) · 1.00 (IKA answer) | **1.00** (`H_INV_DEFAULT`) | IKA 07-12: h=100cm + ≤15° tilt ⇒ solid ⌀154 cm, no center hole; "do NOT lower the mount". Pass `--h-inv 0.924` to model the rig as measured 2026-07-07. |
| Arm base XY | booth URDF (3 seats only) · presets (several) · registry `base_world_m` (only arm 13 surveyed) | **six_arm_display_ADJUSTED_h80.json** | Only complete 6-arm layout on record. |
| Floor base z | 0.6477 world (surveyed, arm 13) vs table top 0.6096 (URDF) / 0.635 (revised scene) | **+0.0127 above paper** | 0.6477 − 0.635 = exactly one base plate (12.7 mm). |
| Pen tip offset | 0.110 below TCP (IKA gate) · 0.209 from flange (ika_workspace) · 0.15 (variable_pressure yaml) · 0.015 (Isaac) | **0.110 below TCP** (`PEN_EXT`) | Gate-B validated against the real touchdown at MZ=0.924. |
| Arm 2 mount | registry: wall plate (pitch π/2, standoff 0.70) · presets/GUI: topdown boom | **topdown** | Matches every preset; the wall experiment still draws on the same paper. Revisit if arm 2 goes active as a wall arm. |
| Sheet size | 218×170 cm (1-arm) · 90×150 (raster) · 360.7×196.1 (6-arm preset) | **360.7×196.1 cm** | The 6-arm planner preset sheet. |
| σ_min gate | 0.08 (ika_workspace default) vs 0.14 (ika_plan strict mask) | **0.14** | Field-validated dual-mask value. |
| Joint margin gate | normalized 0..0.5 (workspace_map) vs absolute rad ≥0.30 (IKA) | **0.30 rad absolute** | IKA binding plan; comparable across joints. |

## CSAIL logo run (2026-08-19)

| Quantity | Values in the wild | We use | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Logo size on the sheet | "~3.3 m wide, nice and big" (brief) | **2.411 x 1.841 m**, centred, 0.06 m margin | The mark's aspect is 212:162 = 1.309, so 3.3 m of width needs 2.52 m of height and the sheet has 1.961. Height binds; distorting a logo to hit a width is not an option. This IS the largest undistorted placement. |
| Source raster | `csail_old_med.gif` 212x162 · `csail_old.jpg` 104x79 | **the .gif** | Twice the linear resolution, indexed palette (37 colours, no JPEG ringing to unmix). |
| Palette | grey ~#8a8c8e / orange ~#c8651b (by eye) | **#666665 / #cb6608** (measured) | The two dominant non-white palette entries in the .gif; the unmixing is a least-squares fit against exactly these, so guessed values would bias every coverage. |
| Wordmark | skeleton like the rest of the art | **boundary contours** | The glyphs are solid, ~31 px wide at 4x against ~11 px lines. A skeleton of a solid "S" is a stick figure; the outline is the letterform. |
| Which arms draw | registry `active` flag: 13, 17, 31, 97 (2 and 71 parked) | **the flag** | Honoured as-is; the 52 % of the logo nobody reaches is reported, not designed around — the brief says arm positions change later. |

Open issues inherited from upstream (not resolved here):
- Base yaw of the inverted arms vs the table axes was never surveyed → per-arm atlases
  are yaw-invariant disks; table-edge clipping per arm is NOT modelled.
- 5 of 6 `base_world_m` entries in `arm_registry.py` are unsurveyed (None).
- Collision checks are the IKA proxies (paper clearance 2 cm, boom cylinder r 0.12);
  real rig geometry lives in `aris_planning_scene.py` upstream and should replace them
  before trusting near-boom / near-edge cells.
- Kinematics use the Panda visual/DH model (identical geometry to FR3; limits are FR3).
